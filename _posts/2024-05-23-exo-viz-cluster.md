When we talk about space, we usually think of the night sky, stars light up. We don't usually think of planets beyond our Solar System. But the study of exoplanets - planets beyond our Solar System - is a crucial gateway to discovering and confirming the existence of extraterrestrial life. 

This project peers into exoplanet science through the lens of data. I grab from the <strong><a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_PS_columns.html" target="_blank" style="color: #573259;"> Planetary Systems</a></strong> dataset provided by the <strong><a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: #573259;">NASA exoplanets archive</a> </strong> on which I'll visualize and conduct a k-means clustering algorithm.

<h3 align="center">Background</h3> 
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<p>Since exoplanet science is younger than most other astronomical sciences This is because, for one, we've known about exoplanets for little time, the first exoplanet discovery was in 1992. Many recent projects have upped the research on exoplanets: </p>
<ul>

  <li>
    At NASA, the <strong>James Webb Telescope</strong> brings in tools capable of exoplanet detection through high-precision spectroscopic observations.
  </li>
  <li>
    In 2027, NASA's <strong>Nancy Grace Roman Telescope</strong> is expected to introduce new exoplanet capabilities using a state-of-the-art coronagraphâ€”a device that can block light from stars to observe neighboring bodies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Further down the horizon, NASA is also working on a flagship project called the <strong>Habitable Worlds Observatory</strong> an  ultraviolet telescope being designed specifically to study habitable exoplanets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contributions elsewhere include <strong>China's Earth 2.0 Space mission</strong>, which will also focus on planet habitability.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>With the relative youth of the domain paired with the rapid technological advances, our discovery exoplanets sees new heights every year. </p>

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<h3 align="center">Data collection and cleaning</h3> 
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

I will draw data from the NASA exoplanets archive, a collaboration between Caltech and NASA under its Exoplanet Exploration Program.
From the parameter table documentation for this dataset I chose a small set of values from the dataset that are likely to be of biggest interest. 

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h5>Querying data</h5>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

To query this data we use the industry standard <strong>Table Access Protocol (TAP)</strong> which uses <strong>AQDL (Astronomical Query Data Language)</strong> - akin to SQL for astronomical databases - as queries. Use Python's <code>requests</code> package to access NASA data using TAP protocol. The following are the variables I've taken:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Planet name</strong> as <code>pl_name</code></li>
  <li><strong>Planet radius</strong> as <code>pl_rade</code></li>
  <li><strong>Planet mass</strong> as <code>pl_masse</code></li>
  <li><strong>Distance from Earth</strong> as <code>sy_dist</code></li>
 <li><strong>Discovery method</strong> as <code>discoverymethod</code></li>
  <li><strong>Discovery year</strong> as <code>disc_year</code></li>
</ul>

I've written a short SQL (technically AQDL) queries which paired with <code>requests</code> grabs these columns:

<p align="center">
  <code>
  <strong>SELECT pl_name, sy_dist, pl_rade, pl_masse FROM ps</strong>
</code>
</p>

To fit it into a <strong><a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/TAP/usingTAP.html" target="_blank" style="color: #573259;">TAP protocol</a></strong> we simply need to make a few adjustments such as remove additional spacing, add <code>+</code> between the major SQL statements. In my process I ingested the data as a CSV into MyDrive to then call it into my notebook.

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h5>Raw data summary</h5>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

After removing the first few columns we obtain a preliminary look at our first data points. The format of these tables is drawn from <strong><a href="https://www.sonofacorner.com/beautiful-tables/" target="_blank" style="color: #573259;"> Beautiful Tables in Matplotlib, a Tutorial</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/how-to-create-custom-tables/?ref=sonofacorner.com" target="_blank" style="color: #573259;">How to create custom tables</a></strong>.

<h3 align="center">Visualization and Analysis</h3>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
Next we will move to visualizing the data we have. Some processing has been omitted here and can be see nin my notebooks. 

I've opted for this project to use <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>seaborn</code>, tools which are sometimes portrayed as lacking in complexity or aesthetic quality. I wanted to develop graphs that still feel dynamic and engaging. I also employed lesser used matplotlib tools such as 3D graphs, tables and style sheets.

<h4>Discovery method</h4>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<p> Examining the methods used to discover planets provides valuable insights into the underlying science. While exoplanets can be discovered in various ways, certain methods have been particularly successful. </p>

The discovery of planets in themselves is an interesting subject because exoplanets are fundamentally harder to detect than other celestial objects such as stars. Scientists have needed to develop complex indirect methods to track exoplanets. 

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>transit method</strong> exploits the shifts in light as a planet passes in front of its host star. The amount of dimming can be used to make conclusions about the planet's characeristics like mass, radiius and eve atmospheric conditions.</li>
  <li>The <strong>radial velocity method</strong> - tracking of gravity induced shifts in a star's position caused by the planet's gravitational pull. </li>
  <li>The <strong>microlensing</strong> technique tracks the bending of light as large exoplanets pass in front of a star.</li>
</ul>

All of these methods require a rich level of spectroscopic data to infer the composition or size of planets. As science progresses, the ability to gather and conduct analysis on this data improves. I have tracked the growth of the three most successful exoplanet discovery methods mentioned above, graphed since the start of the century.

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<p align="center">
  <a href="/assets/img/2024-05-24-exoplanets-J.svg" target="_blank">

  </a>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<strong> Observations </strong>
<ul>
  <li>There's a clear increase in discoveries over the past decade.</li>
  <li>Some years, such as 2016, have seen enormous numbers of exoplanet discoveries. </li>
  <li>The <strong>transit method</strong> is clearly the most successful discovery method.</li>
</ul>

<p> Observational cosmologist Chris Impey mentioned in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbRfJTiQYtA&ab_channel=TheRoyalInstitution" target="_blank" style="color: #573259;">lecture</a> that the growth of discovery of the planets is comparable to the development of internet technology and telephones seen during the Dotcom bubble. So we can easily glean that exoplanet science is progressing at a very rapid pace.</p> 

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h4>Distance from Earth</h4>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

We next track exoplanet distance from Earth; I've generated a histogram (lollipop plot) tracking exoplanets respective to their distance from Earth:

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<p align="center">
  <a href="/assets/img/2024-05-24-exoplanets-D.svg" target="_blank">
  <img src="/assets/img/2024-05-24-exoplanets-D.svg" width="1200" height="600" alt="Graph D" style="border: 3px solid darkgray; border-radius: 3px;">
  </a>
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<strong>Observation(s):</strong>
<ul>
  <li> More planets have been closer to Earth.</li>
  <li> Fairly consistent amount of planets found to 3500 light years away.</li>
  <li> Remarkably, a small number of planets have still been been accessed at 10,000 light years away. Recall, one light year is 9,461,000,000,000 km!</li>
</ul>

<p> We can also better evaluate the distribution of planets as a whole through a cumulative distribution function (CDF):</p>

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<p align="center">
  <a href="/assets/img/2024-05-24-exoplanets-E.svg" target="_blank">
  <img src="/assets/img/2024-05-24-exoplanets-E.svg" width="1200" height="600" alt="Graph E" style="border: 4px solid darkgray; border-radius: 3px;">
  </a>
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<strong>Observation(s):</strong>
<ul>
  <li> Close to 90% of known exoplanets are within the ten thousand light year range. </li>
  <li> In the CDF we notice a highly asymptotic behavior - small number as the distance surpasses 4000 light years. </li>
</ul>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

Unsurprisingly known planets taper off with distance. This is likely due to a few reasons:
- perhaps there is a significant drop in measurement devices.
- sampling bias - closer planets are given more priority
- there are less planers further - unlikely

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<h4> Planet mass and radius </h4>

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
Observing the disparity of planet size and mass can allow us to create a better demographic picture of the planets in our observed universe. Next we will take a look at exoplanet radius and mass. The following is a scatterplot of mass and radius. Note that the scatterplot colors are defined in terms of mass, and the mass is in a logarithmic scale.

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<p align="center">
  <a href="/assets/img/2024-05-24-exoplanets-F.svg" target="_blank">
  <img src="/assets/img/2024-05-24-exoplanets-F.svg" width="910.65" height="720" alt="Graph F" style="border: 4px solid darkgray; border-radius: 3px;">
  </a>
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<strong>Observation(s):</strong>

<ul>
<li> Linear relationship between planet mass and the log of planet radius.</li>
<li> Appear to be two main groups of data, one with smaller radius and mass, another with larger.</li>
<li> A few outliers on the ends.</li>
<li> radius and mass appear to correlate.</li>
<li> Significant fluctuations in planet mass and radius - the heaviest planet is 10000x heavier than Earth. This may be understood by the fact that mass increases exponentially with respect to radius. </li>
</ul>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

However planets differ greatly in their compositions and densities so we would expect there to be quite a bit of fluctuation. 

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>















<h3 align="center"> Machine Learning Classification</h3>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<p>But as NASA puts it, with radius and mass alone "we can see compositions ranging from rocky (like Earth and Venus) to gas-rich (like Jupiter and Saturn)". So those two features alone can play a signfiicant role in classifications, particularly since a planet's mass and size will correlate with its actual geologic properties. </p>

<p>With this in mind I will be conducting a k-means algoirthm using the features of exoplanet radius and exoplanet mass alone using <code>scikit-learn</code>.</p>

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h4> Silhouette score calculation</h4>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<p> To determine the number of categories (clusters) we want to develop, we will use the <strong>silhouette score</strong> method. You may consult my script for a better understanding of this method. High scores indicate good clustering results, bad scores indicate bad results.</p>

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<p align="center">
  <a href="/assets/img/2024-05-24-exoplanets-G.svg" target="_blank">
  <img src="/assets/img/2024-05-24-exoplanets-G.svg" width="800" alt="Graph G" style="border: 4px solid darkgray; border-radius: 3px;">
  </a>
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<strong>Observation(s): </strong>
<ul>
<li>Clearly the most favorable score is 4, so we will divide our exoplanet data into four categories in attempts to match them with existing categories.</li>
</ul>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h4> Apply k-means </h4>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

We run a kmeans model using scikit learn and add the clusters it has generate to our data. In the following graph we display those results, with each cluster differing in color and

  </a>
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<strong>Observation(s):</strong>
<ul>
<li>There doesn't appear to be a strong correlation between mass/radius and distance. This makes sense - we wouldn't expect composition and components of the planets to depend on their distance from Earth</li>
</ul>
